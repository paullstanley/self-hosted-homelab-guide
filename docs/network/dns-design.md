# DNS design

How a name lookup travels in this build, and why each piece is set the way it is. The result: every device on the network uses Pi-hole for DNS whether it wants to or not, the machines that run Pi-hole never depend on it, and upstream queries leave the house encrypted.

Example addresses and names are explained in [Conventions](../start-here/conventions.md); substitute your own.

| **Applies to** | ASUS ZenWiFi XT8 on GNUton Asuswrt-Merlin.ng 3004.388.10_2 (DNS Director), Pi-hole v6 on k3s behind a MetalLB address, cloudflared as the DNS-over-HTTPS proxy |
| **Also works for** | Any Asuswrt-Merlin router with DNS Director, and a Pi-hole on a single machine. Not tested by the author. The node-DNS rule applies to any setup where the DNS server runs on machines that also need DNS |
| **Time** | 20 minutes to set, once Pi-hole exists |
| **You need first** | [ASUS ZenWiFi XT8 router](../hardware/asus-zenwifi-xt8.md); [Pi-hole](../apps/pihole.md) |

## How it works

```
client ──DHCP says "DNS = 192.168.50.11"──▶ Pi-hole ──DNS-over-HTTPS (port 443)──▶ 1.1.1.1 / 1.0.0.1
client with hard-coded 8.8.8.8 ──port 53──▶ router's DNS Director ──redirect──▶ Pi-hole
cluster node ──asks 1.1.1.1 / 9.9.9.9 on port 53──▶ DNS Director rule "Router" ──▶ the router's own resolver
router's own resolver ──DNS-over-TLS (port 853)──▶ 1.1.1.1 / 1.0.0.1
```

Two encrypted paths leave the house, both to Cloudflare: Pi-hole's (DNS-over-HTTPS) for every ordinary device, and the router's (DNS-over-TLS) for the router itself and for the few devices on the "Router" rule. Nothing leaves as plain DNS on port 53.

| Piece | Setting | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DHCP on the router | DNS Server 1 = `192.168.50.11`, DNS Server 2 blank, "Advertise router's IP" = No | Pi-hole is the **only** resolver clients are told about. A second server would be used at random and bypass the blocking |
| IPv6 router advertisements | DNS = `fd00:1234:5678:50::11` only | The same Pi-hole over IPv6. See [Local-only IPv6](local-only-ipv6.md) |
| DNS Director, global | User Defined 1 = `192.168.50.11` | DNS Director is the router feature that rewrites port 53 traffic. Devices with a hard-coded resolver are redirected to Pi-hole anyway |
| DNS Director, per device | **Router** | Exceptions for devices that must not depend on Pi-hole: every cluster node, and a work laptop. Their port 53 traffic is answered by the router's own resolver instead of Pi-hole, whatever server they asked for |
| DNS Director, User Defined 2 and 3 | `1.1.1.1` and blank | Defined but not used by any device. A user-defined rule that points at a dead address leaves every device on it with no DNS |
| Router's own upstream | DNS-over-TLS, strict, to Cloudflare `1.1.1.1` and `1.0.0.1` (`cloudflare-dns.com`); the router's own DNSSEC check off (Cloudflare validates) | What the router itself uses, and what answers the devices on the "Router" rule. See Step 4 |
| Router firewall, IPv6 | REJECT port 53 on the LAN bridge | The router must not become an IPv6 way around Pi-hole |
| Pi-hole upstream | cloudflared sidecar, DNS-over-HTTPS to `1.1.1.1` and `1.0.0.1` | Queries leave on port 443, encrypted, so the ISP cannot read them. Because it is not port 53, **Pi-hole needs no DNS Director exception** |
| Pi-hole pod's own DNS | `127.0.0.1`, then `1.1.1.1` | The pod resolves through itself, with an outside fallback while it starts |
| Pi-hole reverse lookups | Sent to the router for the LAN ranges | Names for devices not listed in Pi-hole's own host list |
| Cluster nodes' own DNS | `1.1.1.1` and `9.9.9.9`, auto-DNS ignored on IPv4 and IPv6 | See the next section |
| CoreDNS (cluster DNS) | Forwards outside names to the node's `/etc/resolv.conf` | So pods also do not depend on Pi-hole. See [CoreDNS](../kubernetes/coredns.md) |

### Why the cluster nodes must not use Pi-hole

It is a chicken-and-egg trap. To start a Pi-hole pod, a node may have to download the image, which needs DNS. If the node's DNS is Pi-hole, and Pi-hole is not running, the node cannot resolve the image registry, and Pi-hole can never start. The pods sit in `ImagePullBackOff`.

This is not theoretical. It happens when:

- the address the nodes used for DNS stops serving DNS (for example Pi-hole moves to a new address), or
- power returns after a cut: the router is up before the nodes, and every node needs DNS before the first Pi-hole pod is ready.

So each node is given outside resolvers, and two things that would quietly put Pi-hole back are blocked:

1. **The router's IPv6 advertisement.** It announces Pi-hole's IPv6 address as DNS. A node set only on the IPv4 side ends up with `1.1.1.1` and `fd00:1234:5678:50::11` in `/etc/resolv.conf`. `ipv6.ignore-auto-dns yes` stops that.
2. **DNS Director.** It redirects the node's port 53 traffic to Pi-hole whatever the node's own settings say. Each node needs a per-device rule that sends it somewhere else. Here that rule is **Router**: the node's lookups are answered by the router's own resolver, which does not depend on the cluster.

As a further cushion, the Pi-hole chart is set to `pullPolicy: IfNotPresent`, so a node that already has the image can start Pi-hole without reaching the registry at all.

## Before you start

- Pi-hole must answer on `192.168.50.11` before you point DHCP at it. Until then the network has no DNS; see [the no-DNS window](#the-no-dns-window-during-a-rebuild).
- List the MAC addresses of the devices that need a DNS Director exception: every cluster node (including a VM node), and anything else that must keep working when Pi-hole is down.
- Decide how the router itself resolves: DNS-over-TLS (what this build uses) or plain DNS. See Step 4.

## Steps

### Step 1. Hand out Pi-hole by DHCP and turn on DNS Director

The bootstrap script in [ASUS ZenWiFi XT8 router](../hardware/asus-zenwifi-xt8.md) sets all of these. By hand, in the router's web UI:

| Page | Setting | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LAN > DHCP Server | DNS Server 1 | `192.168.50.11` |
| LAN > DHCP Server | DNS Server 2 | blank |
| LAN > DHCP Server | Advertise router's IP in addition to user-specified DNS | No |
| LAN > DNS Director | Enable | On |
| LAN > DNS Director | Global Redirection | User Defined 1 |
| LAN > DNS Director | User Defined 1 | IPv4 `192.168.50.11`, IPv6 `fd00:1234:5678:50::11` |
| LAN > DNS Director | User Defined 2 | IPv4 `1.1.1.1` (not used by any device; kept as a ready-made alternative) |
| LAN > DNS Director | User Defined 3 | blank |

> **Pitfall:** do not add an IPv6 DNS server to the DHCP page as a "secondary". Clients already learn Pi-hole's IPv6 address from the router's advertisements, and it is the same Pi-hole.

### Step 2. Add the exceptions

In LAN > DNS Director, add one client rule per device, chosen by MAC address:

| Device | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Each cluster node (`server-1` to `server-4`), and any spare machine that may rejoin | **Router** |
| A work laptop whose VPN client must not be filtered, on each of its network adapters (Wi-Fi, dock, dongle) | **Router** |
| Your own computer while rebuilding | No Redirection (temporary) |

The list holds 64 devices. The three kinds of rule that break the dependency on Pi-hole:

| Rule | What happens to the device's port 53 traffic | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Router** | Redirected to the router's own resolver (dnsmasq), which forwards through the router's upstream from Step 4. The server the device asked for is ignored | You want the device independent of Pi-hole but still encrypted on the way out, and still able to resolve local device names the router knows |
| **No Redirection** | Left alone. The device reaches whatever resolver it is configured with, in plain DNS | Temporary work, or a device that must reach a specific resolver |
| **User Defined 2** | Redirected to `1.1.1.1` in plain DNS | You want one fixed public resolver without involving the router's resolver |

This build uses **Router** for all of them.

> **Why "Router" does not mean Pi-hole here:** the page's help text says "Router" forces clients to "the DNS provided by the router's DHCP server (or the router itself if it's not defined)", and DHCP hands out Pi-hole. In the firmware's code the rule is a plain `REDIRECT` to the router's own address, with no reference to the DHCP setting. So on this firmware a "Router" device is answered by the router, not by Pi-hole. Confirm it on yours with check 10 below.

A node still shows `1.1.1.1` and `9.9.9.9` in its own `/etc/resolv.conf` (Step 3). Those are the addresses it asks; the router answers in their place. Keep them anyway: if DNS Director is ever switched off, the node goes straight to them and keeps working.

### Step 3. Give each cluster node its own resolvers

On Raspberry Pi OS with NetworkManager. Find the connection name first; it is the name printed next to `eth0`.

**Run on: each node**

```bash
nmcli -t -f NAME,DEVICE con show --active
```

Then set the resolvers and ignore the ones offered by DHCP and by router advertisements. Replace the connection name with yours.

**Run on: each node**

```bash
sudo nmcli con mod "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dns "1.1.1.1 9.9.9.9" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes ipv6.ignore-auto-dns yes
sudo nmcli con up "Wired connection 1"
grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf
```

Expected: exactly `nameserver 1.1.1.1` and `nameserver 9.9.9.9`. No `192.168.50.11` and no `fd00:` line. Your SSH session may pause for a moment on the `con up` line. The full node setup, including fixed addresses, is in [Raspberry Pi](../hardware/raspberry-pi.md) and [HA k3s cluster](../kubernetes/k3s-ha-cluster.md).

### Step 4. Choose the router's own upstream

This is what the router itself uses to resolve names, on WAN > Internet Connection. It also answers every device on the "Router" rule from Step 2, so it matters more than it first looks: it is the cluster nodes' DNS.

**Option A: DNS-over-TLS (DoT). This is what the build uses.** The router runs a small encrypting forwarder (`stubby`; you will see it start in the log) and sends its queries over TLS on port 853.

| Setting | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WAN DNS Setting > DNS Server | Assign > Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`) | The plain servers the router falls back on before DoT is up. Use the same provider as the DoT list |
| Forward local domain queries to upstream DNS | No | Names under your local domain never leave the house |
| Enable DNS Rebind protection | Yes | Drops public answers that point at private addresses |
| Enable DNSSEC support | **No** | With DoT this is a second check of what the provider already validated. In the build it was on, and one day it began rejecting stubby's good answers: every lookup by the router (and by every "Router"-rule device) returned SERVFAIL while stubby answered fine ([Troubleshooting](../operations/troubleshooting.md#step-13-nodes-and-the-router-cant-resolve-anything-but-pi-hole-works)). Cloudflare validates DNSSEC itself, and Pi-hole validates for the house |
| Validate unsigned DNSSEC replies | No (goes with the above) | The strictest mode, and the one most likely to fail on unsigned domains |
| Prevent client auto DoH | Auto | Tells browsers not to switch themselves to DNS-over-HTTPS and bypass your DNS |
| DNS Privacy Protocol | DNS-over-TLS (DoT) | |
| DNS-over-TLS Profile | Strict | Never falls back to unencrypted. Opportunistic would |
| DNS-over-TLS Server List | `1.1.1.1` and `1.0.0.1`, TLS Hostname `cloudflare-dns.com` on both | From the Preset servers menu, or typed in |
| TLS Port | blank | The default, 853, is used |
| SPKI Fingerprint | blank | The TLS hostname already verifies the server. A pinned fingerprint breaks DNS when the provider rotates its key |

With DoT selected the page shows a yellow warning: the DHCP server hands out a DNS server other than the router, and DNS Director is on, so clients "bypass DNS Privacy servers". **That is expected in this design.** Ordinary clients go to Pi-hole, which encrypts its own upstream with DNS-over-HTTPS. Only the router and the "Router"-rule devices use the DoT path.

> **Pitfall:** Strict mode means no DNS for the router, and for every device on the "Router" rule, while port 853 to the provider is blocked or the router's clock is badly wrong (TLS needs the right time). After a power cut the router sets its clock from the network first; if cluster nodes fail lookups for the first minute after the router boots, this is why. They recover by themselves.

**Option B: plain DNS.**

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Connect to DNS Server automatically | No |
| DNS Server 1, DNS Server 2 | Two servers of one provider, for example `1.1.1.1` and `1.0.0.1` |
| DNSSEC | On |
| DNS Privacy Protocol | None |

The router's own lookups, and those of the "Router"-rule devices, then leave unencrypted on port 53.

**Tell the bootstrap script which one you chose.** At the top of [`xt8-bootstrap.sh`](../../files/xt8/xt8-bootstrap.sh), `WAN_DNS` and `WAN_DNS2` are the two servers and `WAN_DOT` is `1` for Option A or `0` for Option B. The script sets the plain server fields either way. It does **not** switch DoT on; do that in the GUI. `verify` then checks whichever you declared: with `WAN_DOT=1`, that DoT is on, `stubby` is running and both servers are in the DoT list; with `WAN_DOT=0`, that dnsmasq's upstream is exactly those servers.

> **Checked on GNUton Asuswrt-Merlin 3004.388.10_2:** with DoT on, `nvram get dnspriv_enable` prints `1` and `nvram get dnspriv_rulelist` prints `<1.1.1.1>>cloudflare-dns.com><1.0.0.1>>cloudflare-dns.com>` (one `<address>port>hostname>fingerprint>` group per server, empty fields left empty). The `verify` checks read exactly these. If you export settings with a filter that drops keys containing `priv`, these two disappear from the export; that does not mean they are unset.

### Step 5. Refuse DNS on the router over IPv6

The bootstrap script's `firewall-start` block does this. The rules, for reference:

**Run on: the router** (only if you are not using the bootstrap script; these are lost at the next firewall restart unless they are in `/jffs/scripts/firewall-start`)

```sh
ip6tables -I INPUT -i br0 -p udp --dport 53 -j REJECT
ip6tables -I INPUT -i br0 -p tcp --dport 53 -j REJECT
```

> **Why:** DNS Director's redirect is used here for IPv4. The router's dnsmasq also listens on the router's IPv6 address. Without these rules a client could send queries to `fd00:1234:5678:50::1` and skip Pi-hole.

## Check it

Run the client tests from a personal device on the main Wi-Fi, not from a machine on a VPN.

| # | Test | Run on | Command | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Router settings | the router | `sh /jffs/xt8-bootstrap.sh verify` | `0 failed` |
| 2 | Pi-hole on IPv4 | your computer | `nslookup example.com 192.168.50.11` | An answer |
| 3 | Pi-hole on IPv6 | your computer | `nslookup example.com fd00:1234:5678:50::11` | An answer |
| 4 | Blocking | your computer | `nslookup doubleclick.net` | `0.0.0.0` |
| 5 | Hard-coded DNS is redirected | your computer | `dig @8.8.8.8 example.com`, then look at the Pi-hole query log | An answer arrives **and** the query is in Pi-hole's log |
| 6 | Router refuses IPv6 DNS | your computer | `dig @fd00:1234:5678:50::1 example.com` | Refused or timed out |
| 7 | Upstream is DNS-over-HTTPS | server-1 | `sudo kubectl logs -n pihole deploy/pihole -c cloudflared --tail=20` | Connections to `https://1.1.1.1/dns-query`, no errors |
| 8 | Public leak test | your computer | Open `https://www.dnsleaktest.com` and run the extended test | Only Cloudflare resolvers listed |
| 9 | Node is independent | each node | `grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf` | `1.1.1.1` and `9.9.9.9` only. With the "Router" rule the router answers in their place; see Step 2 |
| 10 | Node is not sent to Pi-hole | a node | `nslookup example.com 1.1.1.1` while watching the Pi-hole query log | The query does **not** appear in Pi-hole |

> **Not verified:** tests 3, 5, 6 and 8 had not been run from a personal device by the author when this was written. Test 10 was also not run. The commands and expected results are the design's intent.

A leak test (test 8) shows which resolvers the outside world sees your queries coming from. Any resolver other than Pi-hole's upstream means some device or path is bypassing Pi-hole.

## The no-DNS window during a rebuild

Between resetting the router and Pi-hole being ready, Pi-hole does not exist, so the network has no DNS. While you work:

1. Set your own computer's DNS to `9.9.9.9` by hand.
2. Add your computer to DNS Director as **No Redirection**.
3. Undo both afterwards.

The same window opens after a power cut or a router restart, and closes by itself, usually within about five minutes:

1. The router is up before the cluster nodes. Devices have no DNS until one Pi-hole pod is ready.
2. Each Pi-hole pod waits 60 seconds and then downloads its blocklists before it answers.
3. The nodes need their **own** DNS at this point. This is the moment a node that depends on Pi-hole deadlocks.

If it has not settled after ten minutes, see [Troubleshooting](../operations/troubleshooting.md).

### Emergency bypass

To get the network working while Pi-hole is being fixed, in the router's web UI:

1. LAN > DHCP Server > DNS Server 1: `9.9.9.9`.
2. LAN > DNS Director > Global Redirection: **No Redirection**.
3. Apply. Devices pick it up as they renew their lease; toggle Wi-Fi on a device to force it.

**Put both back afterwards**: `192.168.50.11` and User Defined 1. `verify` on the router fails until you do, which is a useful reminder.

## Pitfalls

| What happens | Why | Avoid or recover |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New Pi-hole pods sit in `ImagePullBackOff` | The node's own DNS points at Pi-hole or at an address that no longer serves DNS | Step 3 |
| A node's `resolv.conf` lists `fd00:1234:5678:50::11` next to `1.1.1.1` | It is taking Pi-hole from the router's IPv6 advertisement | `ipv6.ignore-auto-dns yes` (Step 3) |
| A node is set correctly but its queries still show in Pi-hole | DNS Director is redirecting it | Step 2 |
| A device has no DNS at all | Its DNS Director rule is a User Defined entry that points at a dead address. Seen when User Defined 3 was a cluster node's own address, which stopped answering DNS when the load balancer changed | Point every User Defined entry at a live resolver |
| `verify` fails a "DNS-over-TLS" check | The script says `WAN_DOT=1` but the WAN page is not set to DoT, or lists other servers | Step 4: make the WAN page and the three `WAN_` values at the top of the script agree |
| `verify` fails "upstream is only ..." | The script says `WAN_DOT=0` but DoT is on, other servers are set, or dnscrypt-proxy is installed | Step 4; or [remove dnscrypt-proxy](../hardware/asus-zenwifi-xt8.md#removing-dnscrypt-proxy) |
| Cluster nodes cannot resolve for a minute after the router restarts | Strict DoT waits for the router's clock and its TLS connection | Nothing; it clears. If it does not, check the WAN page's DoT server list |
| Ping to `192.168.50.11` fails | Normal for a MetalLB address | Test with `nslookup` |
| A VPN'd laptop cannot resolve local names | The VPN sends its DNS to the VPN's own resolver, which never asks Pi-hole | [Client devices](../apps/client-devices.md) |
| The whole cluster is down, so DNS is down | Three Pi-hole pods cover one node failing, not the cluster | Emergency bypass. An optional improvement, not done here, is a second Pi-hole outside the cluster |
| Devices keep the bypass resolver after you restore the settings | They hold their lease | Toggle Wi-Fi, or wait for the lease to renew |

## Troubleshooting

"The internet is down" is almost always DNS. Work from the device outwards.

**Run on: your computer** (the affected device)

```bash
ping -c 2 1.1.1.1
nslookup example.com
nslookup example.com 192.168.50.11
nslookup example.com 1.1.1.1
```

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ping to `1.1.1.1` fails | Not DNS. The connection or the router | Router WAN status, modem, cables |
| Ping works, all three lookups fail | The device cannot reach any DNS | Is it on the right Wi-Fi? Does it have a `192.168.50.x` address? |
| Lookup via `.11` fails, lookup via `1.1.1.1` works | Pi-hole is not answering. DNS Director normally redirects the `1.1.1.1` lookup to Pi-hole too, so this result usually means the device has a DNS Director exception | Check the Pi-hole pods and MetalLB: [Pi-hole](../apps/pihole.md), [Troubleshooting](../operations/troubleshooting.md) |
| Only the default lookup fails | The device is using some other DNS server | On a Mac: `scutil --dns \| grep nameserver`. A VPN is the usual reason |
| Everything works but one site does not | Pi-hole is blocking it | Pi-hole query log, then allow the name in the Pi-hole values file |
| Hundreds of dnsmasq restarts in the router log | dnscrypt-proxy's manager | [Remove it](../hardware/asus-zenwifi-xt8.md#removing-dnscrypt-proxy) |

## Undo

To go back to a plain setup where the router answers DNS: set LAN > DHCP Server > DNS Server 1 to blank, "Advertise router's IP" to Yes, and DNS Director > Enable to Off. On each node, `sudo nmcli con mod "<connection>" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns no ipv6.ignore-auto-dns no ipv4.dns ""` and `sudo nmcli con up "<connection>"`. Note that the bootstrap script's `install` sets the Pi-hole values again whenever it runs.
